# structure2vec-tf

This is the start of implementing a simplified version of structure2vec.

Right now it is in a very preliminary form.

`testing_s2v.py` is generated by jupyter and modified by tudou13 to fix some bugs.

It works fine with `tf.__version__` 1.7.0 and `tf.keras.__version__` 2.1.4-tf.
